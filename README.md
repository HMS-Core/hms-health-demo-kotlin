## Getting Started
Before using Health demo code, check whether the IDE environment has been installed. 
1. Decompress the demo code package.    
2. Copy the Health package into the IDE directory and import it into the IDE Tool.
3. You should also generate a signing certificate fingerprint  and add the certificate file to the project, and add configuration to build.gradle. See (https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides-V5/signing-fingerprint-0000001050071709-V5)
4. Press Sync Project with Gradle Files to ensure the development environment builds completed.

To use functions provided by packages in examples, you need to set parameters as following:
1. HuaweiAccount: Health need verify the user's permission to operate user's health data
2. HMS SDK maven Address:
    * Configure the maven address of the HMS SDK in allprojects-> repositories of project's build.gradle : maven {url 'http://developer.huawei.com/repo/'}
    * Add maven configuration of HMS SDK in buildscript-> dependencies : maven {url 'http://developer.huawei.com/repo/'}
3. Compile dependencies: Add compile dependencies in model's build.gradle : implementation 'com.huawei.hms:hihealth-base:{version}'
4. AppId info: In the application AndroidManifest.xml, add the appId information generated by the Developer Alliance when creating the application.
5. If you want to use the RESTful login function, you must apply for a server app, and replace app information in the HealthKitCloudLogin.java file.
